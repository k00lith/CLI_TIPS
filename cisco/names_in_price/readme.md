What does the suffix BUN stand for ? 

what are the meanings of  suffix  " = " , " BUN " and " -  ?

 
N7K-SUP1-BUN"  ,  "N7K-SUP1- "  ,  "N7K-SUP1= "

---------------------
the "BUN" part usually means that the item is part of a "Bundle" meaning it is sold in a combination with other items. The "=" sign at the end usually means that the part is a spare, it is not sold as part of a configuration but as an extra item to replace a failed item

---------------------

BraovCalos is correct, it just depends on how you plan to order the Supervisor

BUN= Usually included as part of a bundled part number, I.E. comes bundled with the Chassis, Power supplies, and fan modules.
= = This you are ordering as a spare part where you have an existing N7K with one Sup and you want to add another.
-= This usually as some type of name convention after it like N7K-SUP1-8GBUPG

By the way SUP1 has reached end of life and is no longer orderable except for memory upgrades.
